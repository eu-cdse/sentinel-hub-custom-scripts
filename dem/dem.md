# DEM

DEM (digital elevation model) is a 3D representation of the terrain's surface created from terrain elevation data. It can be used for terrain analysis and orthorectification, which helps improve the accuracy of satellite imagery. With DEM, you are able to measure and analyze your area of interest or integrate data into a 3D application as a terrain data source. Sentinel Hub is using MapZen's DEM, available through Amazon Web Services (AWS) in US. This dataset is based on SRTM30 (30 m resolution) but is in several places improved with local datasets. It is static and does not depend on the date (the values are updating as MapZen is improving the dataset). Read the blog post on [how to explore the DEM dataset](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/digital-elevation-model-dem-3c05141bb03d) and [see our API documentation for details](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/dem/).
