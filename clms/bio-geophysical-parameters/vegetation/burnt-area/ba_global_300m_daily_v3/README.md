#  Burnt Area 2023 - present (raster 300 m), global, daily â€“ version 3.1

Maps burn scars, surfaces which have been sufficiently affected by fire to display significant changes in the vegetation cover (destruction of dry material, reduction or loss of green material) and in the ground surface (temporarily darker because of ash).
