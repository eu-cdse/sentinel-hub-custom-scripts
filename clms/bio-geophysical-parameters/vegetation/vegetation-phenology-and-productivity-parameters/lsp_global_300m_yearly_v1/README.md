#  Land Surface Phenology

Land Surface Phenology (LSP) is the term for land surface vegetation phenology estimated from remotely sensed data. It involves the analysis of time series of vegetation indices, which provide quantitative measures of green biomass and photosynthetic activity. LSP is an invaluable indicator in ecosystem studies and climate research.
