## Description
Long term satellite observations of tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) are essential to support air quality and chemistry-climate related studies from the regional to the global scale. The seasonal and inter-annual variations of the formaldehyde distribution are principally related to temperature changes and fire events, but also to changes in anthropogenic (human-made) activities. Its lifetime being of the order of a few hours, HCHO concentrations in the boundary layer can be directly related to the release of short-lived hydrocarbons, which mostly cannot be observed directly from space. Measurements are in mol per square meter (mol/ m^2).
