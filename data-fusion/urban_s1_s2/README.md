## General description of the script  
  
This script is based on the [Urban areas composite for Sentinel-1](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-1/urban_areas/). The script displayes highly reflective VV and VH pixels as built up, limiting them by using basic vegetation and water masking with Sentinel-2. It is prone to overestimation over high slope areas and barren rock.
